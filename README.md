# localizer-task

A pair of tasks for detection and estimation of V1, M1, and A1 BOLD responses. The detection task is a block design with alternating periods of rest, flashing checkerboard (with finger tapping), and listening to tones/music (with finger tapping). The estimation task is a slow event-related design with trials of flashing checkerboard, finger tapping, and tones/music.

These tasks are adapted from a PsychoPy demo task created by Jakub Kaczmarzyk.
